\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
The probabilistic nature of the discriminator can potentially result in  false positives and false negatives during failure discovery. The former can result in unnecessary cycles of plan repair and execution and the latter can cause compounding of failures by missing discovery of errors.  
%
Other limitations include (i) a full observability of the world state causing inability to deal with fully occluded objects, (ii) inability to explicitly recognize when recovery is not possible, e.g., when objects fall off the table and (iii) experiments in simulation alone.
%
Incorporating exploratory actions in planning, recognizing and communicating to a human when recovery plans do not exist and  evaluation on a real robotic test bed remain part of future work.
